Abstract:

The Problem of Assessing business processes or specific components of organizations has been a long dilemma.  Maturity Model is a frequently used technique for assessing business processes or specific components of organizations, as it indicates a path toward a more organized and systematic manner of doing business. A maturity assessment can be used to analyze the current maturity level of a specific part of an organization in a meaningful way, allowing stakeholders to clearly identify strengths and areas for growth, as well as priorities what needs to be done to reach higher maturity levels. Through a series of questions, a maturity evaluation assesses the respondent's maturity in one or more areas.
